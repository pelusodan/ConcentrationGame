# ConcentrationGame
My first iOS application! Following the Stanford course to learn another exciting mobile platform.

### Motivations

While I agree the idea of making a concentration game is not the most interesting project, it has the potential to be a great
learning platform. With this I plan to familiarize myself with the basics of the Apple UIKit, popular MVC architecture models,
and the XCode developing platform as a whole. 

## Status:

Right now I've got some simple cards you can flip with emojis, as well as a basic live counter of how many 'flips' the user 
has incurred.
