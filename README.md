# ConcentrationGame
My first iOS application! Following the Stanford course to learn another exciting mobile platform.

### Motivations

While I agree the idea of making a concentration game is not the most interesting project, it has the potential to be a great
learning platform. With this I plan to familiarize myself with the basics of the Apple UIKit, popular MVC architecture models,
and the XCode developing platform as a whole. 

## Status:

The game is currently working! I've added in 6 new themes, from which a random one will be chosen at the beginning of the
new game. The flip counter resets with a new game.
